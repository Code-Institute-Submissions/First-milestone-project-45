            <p class="lead text-center">
              Building in an environmentally friendly way has many benefits,
              along with being both incredibly rewarding and cost effective too.
              Not only are you helping to look after the environment but you’ll
              also enjoy lower bills, increased energy efficiency and your home
              will require less maintenance over time. With a wealth of
              information and support available, it is now easier than ever
              before to create a greener and more energy efficient home. There
              are many types of eco homes available to buy or self build
              nowadays, below are examples of three beautiful concepts of eco
              homes.

              Built with natural, waste truck tyres and other recycled
              materials, Earthships create comfortable and cosy living spaces
              without relying on public utilities. They use the planets natural
              systems to provide all utilities - using the sun's energy and rain
              to provide heat, power and water. They are totally self-sufficient
              The buildings heat and cool themselves, harvest their own 
              water and use plants to treat their sewage. They are energy efficient
              and conserve rainwater.

            <p class="card-text">
              Tiny Homes are about living simply, beautifully and yet still with
              everything you need. It’s about freedom from debt and having the
              economic freedom to live a bigger life, instead of having a bigger
              house. Living in a Tiny House carries a much smaller environmental
              footprint, reduces the amount of resources we as humans consume to
              live, encourages us to consume less in general and are much easier to 
              maintain because the house is significantly smaller.

            <p class="card-text">
              To some the thought of building a house out of steel shipping
              containers fills them with dread. However the real picture is
              somewhat different as both architects and self build home owners
              have proved that beautiful structures including houses can be
              built using this method. The flexibility of adding more space when
              needed, the cost savings from conventional building methods and
              the choice of finish makes the shipping container home a thing of
              beauty.

              Off grid living means to live on your own without being connected
              or dependent on urban infrastructures. You produce your own power,
              use your own water source, and maybe even grow your own food. You
              can live off the grid and start experiencing a free and
              independent life. More than that, living off the grid also means
              you save a lot of money in the long run. The surrounding environment will
              supply you with all the energy, heat, water and food you need.

            <p class="card-text">
              Zero-waste living means aiming to reduce landfill-bound trash to
              the bare minimum—a worthy goal considering that a plastic bag
              could take up to 1,000 years to decompose in a landfill. When you
              look through your trash, you’ll probably find discards that could
              be recycled, reused or repurposed. Some people manage to fit their
              year’s worth of waste in a small jar by buying second hand goods,
              not buying plastic packaged goods. It's not easy and there's a lot
              of discipline involved but worth it.

              Eco friendly products are an easy alternative in replacing some of
              the plastic products you buy. By replacing them, you can virtually
              eliminate your single use plastic pollution in that area. Many eco
              products replace the plastic material with sustainable natural
              materials such as wooden cutlery, bamboo toothbrushes, coconut
              fibre scrubbers, glass containers, metal lunchboxes, water bottles
              and tins, shampoo bars and conditioner bars and recycled
              materials.
