# Greener Homes
A website for users who would like to know more about ecologically sustainable houses, environmentally friendly lifestyle and affordable housing. 
The website consists of a 3 page website with beautiful quality photos, pleasing to the eye, inspiring to look at and simple, not too 
much text, as for myself I don’t like busy looking websites, I like simplicity and beauty. As too much information gets confusing, messy 
and overwhelming.

I wanted to create a website introducing ecological sustainable homes as it’s something that interests me. To show how beautiful and modern 
they look, and how affordable they can be. There are many different concepts of eco homes but I decided to show three of my favourites which 
are Earthships, Tiny Houses, and Shipping Container Homes as I wanted to keep it simple. Aiming at those who are beginning to be curious 
about ecological, sustainable housing it will introduce ideas such as buying an eco home, self-building their own home, information about 
three types of ecologically sustainable homes available, although there are many more types of eco homes.

Reasons users may be searching for an alternative home or way of living:
- Change of financial circumstances, downsizing, or wanting to become mortgage free. 
- User is generally interested in environmental issues concerning housing and lifestyle. 
- Researching without any intention of buying or self-building but may do so in the future - User is researching ecological sustainable 
homes for educational purposes and this website is a good start.
- User is concerned about their environmental footprint and are seeking ideas and inspiration of how to change their everyday lifestyle.
- User is wanting to be completely self-sufficient and live off the grid as much as possible.

# UX

A simple and clean website that introduces the user to eco homes and environmentally friendly lifestyle, consisting of 3 pages:
- A home page that introduces eco homes with images, brief description and links to quality external websites to save them from clicking 
through the many results appearing in a google search. Additional related content of ecological home products, zero waste lifestyle, and off 
the grid living are also introduced with a brief description and link to an external website giving more information.
- A resources page that gives further information in researched quality website links, introductory videos of earthships, tiny houses and 
shipping container homes and recommended books with links to author's website or where to buy the book.
- A contact us page that allows the user to communicate with the imaginary team to give them more information about anything they found 
on the Greener Homes website.



## User journey:
1. The user begins at the home page, reading the information about what this website is about and what an eco home is.

The user’s goals can be met via this website as it gives an introduction to these concepts as well as direction to further quality online 
resources in website links, video links and recommended books.

As this subject area is quite vast it was important to keep it simple looking and in content too as to not overwhelm beginners. 
Most websites I have found are full of information and the user experience feels overloaded by the information with the cramped layouts 
and popping adverts, having to click them to close.

  

It is easy to navigate with the navbar fixed on top, so the user can choose to go to another page wherever they are on the current page.

# Features

All three pages consists of a fixed navigation menu bar on top where you can click to go to any of the three pages wherever you are on 
the current page. The three pages also consist of the same footer with four social links taking them to a new tab with the relevant social 
media homepage as there are no 'Greener Homes' social media accounts. Underneath is the copyright information.

I chose a simple clean font called 'Open Sans' to stay consistent with the overall look of being simple and clean. The font colours of mid-grey: rgb(69, 71, 69),
 button colours of green bg-success and social links in green: rgb(31, 160, 31) to link the Greener Homes to the colour green.

### Home.html

This page has a hero image of a beautiful landscape reminding the user of the beauty of the natural environment, inspiring the user to 
feel calm and to protect the environment. The name of the website ‘Greener Homes’ is displayed, underneath is a concise introduction in the ‘About Us’ section of what 
the website intends to do.

Next heading is ‘Why live in an eco home’ explaining the benefits of living in such a home and among the many variations of eco homes, 
this website chooses the three most popular: Earthships, Tiny Houses and Shipping Container Homes. These sections are in a simple and organised 
format which is easy to read and not overwhelming to the user.

Then the three examples of the eco homes, set in card decks with a beautiful image of each type of home, the name of the type of home and 
a brief concise summary of its benefits and features. A button follows indicating more information when clicked, which opens a new tab for 
the external website providing more information.

The next section is called ‘Related Interests’ which includes ‘Off Grid Living’, “Zero Waste Living’ and “Eco Home Products’ another card 
deck of three as above to keep the style consistent. Each card has a beautiful and informative image of what the subject is about and a 
concise description of its benefits and features. A button at the bottom of the card when clicked also opens into a new tab for the 
external link providing more information.

Then is the ‘Sign Up’ form inviting the user to enter their email address to sign up for Greener Homes latest news. Reassuring the user 
that their email address will not be shared with others. A ‘Sign Up!’ Button for the user to click once the email address is entered. 
If the user clicks the button without entering a valid email address it gives a message to fill in the appropriate field.

### Resources.html

Under the navbar is a hero image of a row of lightbulbs giving the user a visual cue that this page is for ideas to inspire and inform them. 
Again the heading ‘Greener Homes’ underneath to keep the style consistent. A brief introduction of what the page consists of to help them 
understand more about the subject.

Next section is a heading introducing ‘Website Links’ with three group lists of links, first list for Earthships, second list for Tiny 
Houses and the third list for Shipping Container Homes. When user hovers over a link the colour changes to a darker shade of green. Each 
link has been weeded out from a large result of online searches saving the user time from doing that. Each link opens up into a new tab 
of the external website. When the link is clicked it shows a blue border to indicate that was the last link clicked, which is useful for 
when the user goes back to the page.


Next section is for the ‘Video Links’, for people who don’t want to read and prefer to watch a small video introducing the three different 
concepts of eco homes. Each one plays on the page, or click the fullscreen icon or a link to play on YouTube website.

Finally, there is the 'Book Resources’ section with five cards each with an image of the book cover and a name of what kind of book it is 
and then a link to an external website either the author’s website or where to buy it. When the link is clicked it opens into a new tab so 
the user does not forget or lose viewing the Greener Homes website.

### Contact.html

This is a simple page with a hero image of a beautiful earthship eco home to inspire the user, again the heading title of ‘Greener Homes’ 
to keep the style consistent. Underneath the section is introduced with a heading ‘Let’s Get in Touch!’ with a little content explaining 
to the user that if they would like some more information or other resources to please fill in the form below.

Again like in the previous form on the home page reassuring the user that their email will not be shared with anyone else.

The form is validated so that the user has to fill in the different sections of the form before they move onto the next part, to finally
 submit it.

## Features Left to Implement

- To be able to actually submit the forms and give an email confirmation that the information was received and welcoming the user to the 
Greener Homes community.

- Community blog page where other users can share their experiences of buying, building eco homes from different companies, or how they 
did it themselves. Shared experiences and connecting users to how they integrate zero waste living, or off the grid living and recommend 
eco home products.

- Real social media accounts.

## Code

The code for my footer social links was copied from Code Institute source code for the resume project in the user centric frontend development module.

CI tutor helped me clarify what code to use for column sizes and directed me to CSS page https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp to help with background image responsiveness. So updated all the hero images on 4 pages.

Used code from https://css-tricks.com/books/fundamental-css-tactics/scale-typography-screen-size/ to help with font-size responsiveness.

Mentor gave link to help rectify the white space on the right of screen on mobile phone view https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34284976/blank-space-right-side-screen-on-small-device-or-window/34285689#34285689?newreg=609753b69d114fe8855ce8929c156ee3

# Acknowledgements

I received inspiration for this project from when I done a webpage about eco homes and wanted to expand to make it a website.

Also thank you to the slack channel, many CI tutors and mentor Precious.
