# Greener Homes

The website consists of a 3 page website with beautiful quality photos, pleasing to the eye, inspiring to look at and simple, not too much text, as for myself I don’t like busy looking websites, I like simplicity and beauty. As too much information gets confusing, messy and overwhelming.

I wanted to create a website about ecological sustainable homes as it’s something that interests me. To show how beautiful and modern they look, and how affordable they can be. There are many different concepts of eco homes but I decided to show three of my favourites Earthships, Tiny Houses, and Shipping Container Homes as I wanted to keep it simple.

Reasons users may be searching for an alternative because of change of financial circumstances, downsizing, or wanting to become mortgage free. User is generally interested in environmental issues concerning housing and lifestyle and researching without any intention of buying or self-building but may do so in the future or user is researching ecological sustainable homes for educational purposes and this website is a good start.
User is concerned about their environmental footprint and are seeking ideas and inspiration of how to change their everyday lifestyle.
User is wanting to be completely self-sufficient and live off the grid as much as possible.

# UX

A simple and clean website that introduces the user to eco homes, consists of 3 pages, home page that introduces eco homes with images, brief description and links to quality external websites to save them from clicking through the many results all in a google search.

A website for users who would like to know more about ecologically sustainable houses, alternative lifestyle and affordable housing. Aiming at those who are beginning to be curious about ecological, sustainable housing it will introduce ideas such as buying an eco home, self-building their own home, information about three types of ecologically sustainable homes available, although there are many more. The other types of homes available are in recommended books, links available to buy, as there is so much information and many ways to make a home ecologically sustainable, I decided to pick three of the most popular. 


Additional related content of ecological home products, zero waste lifestyle, and off the grid living are also introduced with a brief description and link to an external website giving more information.

User stories:

User wants a simple and clean looking website as messy, busy pages with lots of information overwhelms them.
User wants an easy to navigate website to save time and not get frustrated or lost.
User wants to know what this website is about and how it can help them.

The user’s goals can be met via this website as it gives an introduction to these concepts as well has direction to further quality online resources in website links, video links and recommended books.

As this subject area is quite vast it was important to keep it simple looking and in content too as to not overwhelm beginners. Most websites I have found are full of information and the user experience feels overloaded by the information with the cramped layouts and popping adverts, having to click them to close.

It is easy to navigate with the navbar fixed on top so user can choose to go to another page wherever they are on the current page.



Wireframes


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

#Features

All three pages consists of a fixed navigation menu bar on top where you can click to go to any of the three pages wherever you are on the current page. The three pages also consist of the same footer with four social links taking them to a new tab with the relevant social link. Underneath is the copyright information.

I chose a simple clean font open sans to stay consistent with the overall look of being simple and clean. The font colours of mid grey # and icon and button colours of green bg-success to link the Greener Homes to the colour green.

Home.html

This page has a hero image of a beautiful landscape reminding the user of the beauty of the natural environment, inspiring the user to feel calm.

The name of the website ‘Greener Homes’ is displayed, underneath is a concise introduction in the ‘About Us’ section of what the website intends to do.

Next heading is ‘Why live in an eco home’ explaining the benefits of living in such a home and among the many variations of eco homes, this website chooses the three most popular, Earthships, Tiny Houses and Shipping Container Homes. These sections are in a simple spaced out format which is easy to read and not overwhelming to the user.

Then the three examples of the eco homes, set in card decks with a beautiful image of each type of home, the name of the type of home and a brief concise summary of its benefits and features. A button follows indicating more information when clicked, which opens a new tab for the external website providing more information.

The next section is called ‘Related Interests’ which includes ‘Off Grid Living’, “Zero Waste Living’ and “Eco Home Products’ another card deck of three as above to keep the style consistent. Each card has a beautiful and informative image of what the subject is about and a concise description of its benefits and features. A button at the bottom of the card when clicked also opens into a new tab for the external link providing more information.

Then is the ‘Sign Up’ form inviting the user to enter their email address to sign up for Greener Homes latest news. Reassuring the user that their email address will not be shared with others. A ‘Sign Up!’ Button for the user to click once the email address is entered. If the user clicks the button without entering a valid email address it gives a message to fill in the appropriate field.

Resources.html

Under the navbar is a hero image of a row of lightbulbs giving the user a visual cue that this page is for ideas to inspire and inform them. Again the heading ‘Greener Homes’ underneath to keep the style consistent. A brief introduction of what the page consists of to help them understand more about the subject.
Next section is a heading introducing ‘Website Links’ with three group lists of links, first list for Earthships, second list for Tiny Houses and the third list for Shipping Container Homes. Each link has been weeded out from a large result of online searches saving the user time from doing that. Each link opens up into a new tab of the external website.

Next section is for the ‘Video Links’, for people who don’t want to read and prefer to watch a small video introducing the three different concepts of eco homes. Each one plays on the page or a link to play on YouTube website.

Finally, there is the 'Book Resources’ section with five cards each with an image of the book cover and a name of what kind of book it is and then a link to an external website either the author’s website or where to buy it.

Contact.html

This is a simple page with a hero image of a beautiful earthship eco home to inspire the user, again the heading title of ‘Greener Homes’ to keep the style consistent. Underneath the section is introduced with a heading ‘Let’s Get in Touch!’ With a little content explaining to the user that if they would like some more information or other resources to please fill in the form below.
Again reassuring the user that their email will not be shared with anyone else.

The form is validated so that the user has to fill in the different sections of the form before they move onto the next part, to finally submit it.

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

##Contact.html in phone (iPhone X, 6, 7, 8) view.

In mobile phone mode, the navigation menu bar on the top is fixed and the burger icon appears. When clicked the drop down menu appears with the ‘Home’, ‘More Resources’ and ‘Contact Us’, when you click on them the font colour goes a dark grey and then goes back to the original light grey.

**When you scroll up the top part of the burger icon is hidden on the navigation bar but still clickable. For the top margin to appear user has to scroll down.

The hero image displays the full width of the browser with no distortions just trimmed on either side of the image. The main heading ‘Greener Homes’ and sub-headings ‘Let’s Get In Touch’, the content the horizontal dividers are centred on the page. The fonts have decreased in size to adjust to the smaller size and looks in proportion to each other.

The form is centred on the page. All the text and text box areas are equally spaced and within the border of the form. There are no margins on either side of the form but looks good, it is consistent with the hero image.

When user selects a text area a thin blue border appears. ***too thin is very hard to see.

**The ‘Full Name’ field is accepting all characters and numbers and just one name. So would like to validate it so it only accepts letters and two names at least.

If the ‘Email Address’ field is not filled then the message ‘Please fill in this field’ appears.

If the ‘Full Name’ field is not filled then the message ‘Please fill in this field’ appears.

If the ‘Email Address’ field is not valid and you click the ‘Submit’ button then the message ‘Please include a ‘@‘ in the email address ‘___’ is missing a ‘@‘ appears.

If the ‘Email Address’ field has been partly filled in with half the email address and you click the ‘Submit’ Button then another message comes up ’Please enter a part following ‘@‘, ‘___@‘ is incomplete’.

***The form goes to the top of the page and the form clears when the ‘Full Name’ and ‘Email Address’ fields are filled, even without the ‘Message’ field being filled.

When you click the ‘Submit’ button it goes a darker green and stays that colour until you click on another part of the screen.

The horizontal divider and social links are centred at the bottom of the page. The social media links are equally spaced and in a row. All links opens up a new tab to the external website.

##Bugs whilst creating the website:

Navbar code was copied from Bootstrap 4, I found the dropdown menu wouldn’t work and searched on slack and found I had to change the script order of bootstrap to js, query, css.

Changed the height size of the card decks on home page with bootstrap card custom css sizing, but undid the code for this as the content was coming out of the box when the screen was reduced.

Used a card element for sign up form and added a form element inside and changed the width with grid size.

Font was different on one of the three pages, so had to re-copy and paste the code again.

My images weren’t showing up in preview or GitHub but a tutor saw that I had ‘../‘ in front of the pathway and by deleting them it worked.

Tutor Tim helped clarify what code to use when with col sizes and directed me to css page https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp to help with background image responsiveness. So updated all the hero images on 4 pages.

Used codes from this website to help with font-size responsiveness:
https://css-tricks.com/books/fundamental-css-tactics/scale-typography-screen-size/

Also got advice from tutor Stephen advising me what options I had for image responsiveness. With https://code-institute-a61370e921d3.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/210427055/093851c6c8c5e651e89f9cbc/ex.png


Mentor gave link to help rectify the white space on the right on mobile device: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34284976/blank-space-right-side-screen-on-small-device-or-window/34285689#34285689?newreg=609753b69d114fe8855ce8929c156ee3 - checking each parent element on devtools.

Answer was applying zero to margin and padding to body in css.

Horizontal divider line on resource page was going across the width of page so had to move the container end tag div to the end of the section so the padding would apply to all the child elements.


For testing writeup there are basically 5 parts.
1) List the websites you used to validate your code and what they are for.
2) Go through the user stories you wrote in the UX part of your readme, and explain how your website meets those needs.
3) Write about how each part of your responsive website behaves on different screen sizes.

And if you want to knock the grade for testing all the way up to the max:
4) Manually go though every part of your site and write out how you confirmed that each link, hover effect and other interactive parts of the site work as you expect.
5) List any bugs you came across while creating the site and while testing it. Include the fixes you came up with. (I have two sections here, one for fixed bugs and one for bugs I have not found a solution for yet.)

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

#Deployment

##How I deployed my First Milestone Project from Github repository.

Go to github.com
Log into my account
Click on ‘Repositories’
Click on ‘First Milestone Project’
Click on ‘Settings’
Scroll down to the ‘Github Pages’ section.
Under the ‘Source’ heading there is a dropdown menu click on ‘None’, and select ‘Master Branch’.
The page refreshes and goes back to the top of the page, scroll down to ‘Github Pages’ section and find ‘Your site is ready to be published at ________’ with your link. The website is deployed.

Source: https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site

##How I deployed my First Milestone Project locally, by cloning in Github to Repl.

Go to github.com
Log into my account
Click on ‘Repositories’
Click on ‘First Milestone Project’
Click on the green button ‘Clone or download’
Click on ‘Download Zip’
Open IDE (Repl.it)
Upload folder or files

##How I deployed my First Milestone Project locally by cloning in Github to Gitpod.

Go to github.com
Log into my account
Click on ‘Repositories’
Click on ‘First Milestone Project’
Click on the green button ‘Clone or download’
Click on the icon that looks like a clipboard with an arrow (this copies URL link)
Open repo or create new repo
Open terminal
Type git clone and paste URL link and press enter.



This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

In your first milestone (and future ones) there are 5 whole points out of 100 awarded for your deployment write up. But a lot of new students don't really get what that means, and so their writeup misses out on points that are actually very easy to get.

Deployment means what you did to make your website live and working for other people to look at.

Deployment is NOT pushing from GitPod to GitHub, and it is not the preview that GitPod gives you to view your working code.

For the first two of milestones Deployment is getting your site working on GitHub pages (It gets a lot more complex in the last two milestones!)

So when you come to deploy your site to github pages, you need to take a few steps to do that in the github settings. How to do that can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages

You need to include these steps in your readme on how it was deployed.
Basically explain to another developer who might work on your code, how you got the page up and running. (Later in the course the deployment section will get more complex, but if you want the best marks be pedantic and write it out in your readme this time too!)

Also, deployment includes writing up how to run your code locally. So explain how to pull your code from your github repository (you don't need to give any passwords) so someone could clone your code to work on on their own machine. Here is how to do that: https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository Include these steps in your readme.md too and that's the deployment section of your readme sorted.

##Code

The code for my footer social links was copied from Code Institute source code for the resume project in the user centric module.

CI tutor helped me clarify what code to use for column sizes and directed me to CSS page https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp to help with background image responsiveness. So updated all the hero images on 4 pages.

#Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project from when I done a webpage about eco homes and wanted to expand to make it a website.

Also thank you to the  slack channel, many CI tutors and mentor Precious.
